If you are reading this you may need a tool for simulating the rotation of small electromagnets inside a constant magnetic field, if that's the case, this is your repo! If you just wanna see some coils spinning, you are also wellcome ;). With this project you can design/save/modify as many coils as you are capable of and then fix them into specific rotation axis an see the ressult.

***Here are the movement and torque graphs of the simulation you saw on the gif above:***
